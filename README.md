# To-Do List App
**A To-Do List App built as part of The Web Developer Bootcamp course**

This app was built to practice newly acquired skills in HTML, CSS and the JS library jQuery. At the same time it served as a sandbox project to learn more about how to structure and refactor code, linting and style guides (Airbnb) in VSCode, working with git and creating packages with npm. Plus, it was a valuable experience to observe the differences and interactions between vanilla JS and jQuery.

## Features
* Add new items to the to-do list
* Mark completed items as done
* Delete items from the to-do list
* Show/hide input field for new items
* Responsive design

## Additional features
In addition to the ones mentioned above, these extra features are planned in order to practice with new concepts:
- [x] Re-order to-do list by dragging and dropping with native HTML
- [x] Dynamic display of icon depending on whether input field is shown or hidden
- [x] Any user input entered is removed from input field when elements loses focus
- [ ] Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate page [**planned**]
- [x] Own personal design using CSS
- [ ] Refactor JS/jQuery code [**planned**]
