# To-Do List App
**A To-Do List App built as part of The Web Developer Bootcamp course**

This app was built to practice newly acquired skills in HTML, CSS and the JS library jQuery. At the same time it served as a sandbox project to learn more about how to structure and refactor code, linting and style guides (Airbnb) in VSCode, working with git and creating packages with npm.

## Features
* Add new items to the to-do list
* Mark completed items as done
* Delete items from the to-do list
* Show/hide input field for new items
* Responsive design

## Additional features
In addition to those mentioned above, the extra features below are planned to be included as a means of practice:
- [ ] Re-order the to-do list by dragging and dropping with native HTML [**planned**]
- [ ] Dynamic display of icon depending on whether input field is shown or hidden [**planned**]
- [ ] Own personal design using CSS [**planned**]
